# MakeChangeProject

### Overview

This program simulates a cash register and will tell you your change
broken down to the denomination which you would be paid! (Example: One Dollar
  and 3 Quarters!)

  ### Technologies Used

  - Java
  - Conditionals
  - Looping

### How To Run
Once project is ran you will be prompted for your item total, enter a price.
Once entered you will then be prompted for cash tendered. Enter an amount.
After this step is completed the magic happens! Your change will be displayed
in the console separated by denomination.
### Lessons Learned (Pos/Neg)
Pos +
I have progressed a lot in terms of combining basic java functions into the same
program. In the prework I struggled to combine methods when dealing with
variables and returning values. This exercise has taught me how to do so.

Neg -
Though the overall project came to me almost naturally (somehow). I did hit a
roadblock when trying to sysout the change. I was initially working with doubles
and casting them into integers in my sysout. Which was fine in some cases but
in others I continually got less pennies or more than I should have. As a
result I had to pivot and multiply my change by 100 in order to deal with
strictly integers and the rounding problem I had fixed itself.
